    Args:
        base_url: The base URL to crawl.
        output_dir: The directory to download the files to.
        session: The requests session used for HTML enumeration. When `max_workers == 1`, this
            session is also used for the file transfers; otherwise its `auth` and `headers` are
            cloned onto each worker session created via `session_factory`.
        max_workers: Number of parallel file downloads. Defaults to 1 (sequential).
            Values > 1 fan out the file transfers across a thread pool; this is the lever
            that beats PhysioNet's ~50 KB/s per-connection cap, since they do not appear
            to throttle aggregate per-IP throughput. Note that even at `max_workers == 1`
            the implementation now fully enumerates the directory tree before downloading
            any files (rather than the prior interleaved crawl+download). For typical
            PhysioNet-shaped datasets (tens of files, two-deep tree) this is sub-second
            and a few KB of memory; the unified path keeps sequential and parallel modes
            from drifting apart over time.
        session_factory: Required when `max_workers > 1` (raises `ValueError` if missing).
            Called exactly `max_workers` times up-front to mint per-worker `requests.Session`s,
            which are then checked out / returned via a queue across files (so each worker pays
            the TCP/TLS handshake once, not per file). Each worker's session inherits `auth`
            and `headers` from the enumerating `session` so authenticated downloads work
            transparently. Ignored when `max_workers == 1`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `max_workers > 1` is requested without a `session_factory`, or if any
            download fails. With `max_workers > 1`, all downloads run to completion before the
            failure is raised, so a single bad URL doesn't leave the other workers half-finished;
            the raised error includes the count of failures plus the first failing URL, with the
            original exception attached as `__cause__`.

    Interrupt behavior (`KeyboardInterrupt` / `SystemExit`): the parallel path cancels
    queued downloads immediately, but in-flight downloads run to completion — closing
    an SSL stream from the main thread mid-`iter_content` deadlocks OpenSSL's
    per-socket lock, so there's no clean in-process way to abort an active read.
    The shipped CLI installs a SIGINT handler in `__main__.py` that escalates to
    `os._exit(130)` on the second Ctrl+C; library callers wanting the same fast-exit
    UX should do the same.
